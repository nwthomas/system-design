## SUMMARY

In the world of databases, there are really two main types of solutions on the market - SQL and NoSQL, or Relational or Non-Relational Databases.

Both of these differ in the _reasons_ and _way_ they were built, the information they store, and the way that they store that data.

Relational databases were structured to have predefined schemas like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses.

Non-relational databases are unstructured, distributed, and have a dynamic schema like file folders that hold everything from a person's address and phone number to their Facebook "likes" and online shopping preferences.

## SQL

SQL or relational databases store data in rows and columns. Each row contains all the information that is needed about an entityt while each column is a separate data point. Some of the most popular RDs include MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB.

## NO-SQL

These are different types of NoSQL Databases ‚§µÔ∏è

### KEY-VALUE STORES

Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The key is an attribute name which is linked to a value. Well-known key-value stores include REdix, Voldemort, and Dynamo.

### DOCUMENT DATABASES

In document databases, data is store in documents (instead of rows and columns) and are grouped together in collections. Each document can have an entirely different structure. Document databases include CouchDB and MongoDB.

### WIDE-COLUMN DATABASES

Instead of tables, wide-column databases have column families which are containers for rows.

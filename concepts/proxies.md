## SUMMARY

A proxy server is an intermediate server between the client and the back-end. Clients connect to the proxy server to make a request for a service like a web page, file, or connection. Proxies are software or hardware that act as intermediaries for requests from clients.

Proxies are typically used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests (by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compressing a resource). Another advantage of a proxy server is that its cache can server a lot of requests. If multiple clients access the same resource, a proxy can cache it and server it to all the clients without going back and forth repeatedly to the remote server.

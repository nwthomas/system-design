# SYSTEM DESIGN üë©‚Äçüíª üï∏ üë®‚Äçüíª

In the spirit of learning in public, I'll be committing my notes from the [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/learn) course [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview).

System Design Interviews are always interesting, and I've wanted to go take a course on them for a long time. If you're reading this, I hope you enjoy this repository. It is like a living document and will likely be updated throughout my career. I expect that I'll eventually strip any mention of Educative out of it and generalize all the documents while adding more content of my own.

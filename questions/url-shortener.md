## WHY DO WE NEED URL SHORTENING?

URL shortening is useful to gain "short links" that redirect to longer ones.

These short links are effectively aliases and save a _ton_ of space when posting/tweeting/etc. Users are also less likely to type in the wrong characters when using shorter links.

They are also useful to track clicks/user engagement with content.

# DESIGN A RATE LIMITER

A rate limiter is used in a network system to control the rate of traffic sent by a client or a service. This limits the number of client requests in HTTP sent over a specified period. All excess requests are usually blocked.

Example:

- Users can write no more than 2 posts per second per user
- You are capped at a max of 10 accounts per day from a given IP address
- You can claim rewards no more than 5 times per week from the same device
